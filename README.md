# FizzBuzz in Rust

An extremely [straightforward](src/main.rs) implementation of FizzBuzz in Rust.

## What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem, often used to screen developers in
software engineering interviews. The goal of FizzBuzz is to write a program that
prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but instead for multiples of three print `Fizz`
and for multiples of five print `Buzz`. For multiples of both print `FizzBuzz`.
Here is the expected result for the first 20 numbers:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
```

## What is Rust?

Rust is a general purpose programming language designed for safety and
performance. We only use the [safest and fastest](src/main.rs) Rust to solve
FizzBuzz.

## Why would you write this?

There are no other examples on the internet of using Rust to solve FizzBuzz, so
I contributed my own[.](docs/SOLUTION.md)

## How to build and run this?

Type `cargo run`. You can also run this online on the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=81b6d4f2467b467458b82e6574459aa6).
